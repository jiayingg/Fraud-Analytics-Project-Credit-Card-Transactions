# Fraud Analytics Project: Credit Card Transactions

*Corporate Card Transaction Data is dataset recorded 95,272 credit card transactions made during the year of 2010. For each transaction record, thereâ€™s detailed information of card number, transaction date, merchant number, merchant state and zip, etc. In addition, each record is given a fraud label indicating whether or not the record is categorized as a fraud. There are total of 4000 fraudulent transaction records. Through supervised and unsupervised (where we mask the labels) learning method, we built several different linear and nonlinear models to compute a fraud score for each record, and use the fraud labels to calculate our fraud detection rate. The goal is to catch as many fraudulent transactions as possible.*
